    "The *Engine Predictive Maintenance System* (EPMS) is a predictive maintenance system for turbofan engines. It is built to predict degradation and failure on mock data from turbofan jet engines. It tries to predict the remaining useful life (RUL) of the engine based on sensors data given by the engine and send alerts to the maintenance team when the engine is predicted to fail to avoid unexpected breakdowns, wich is most expensive than waiting for the engine to drown.\n",
